# HTTP-Server-Client

Instead of using a browser, write your own HTTP client to test your server. Your client will connect
to the server using a TCP connection, send an HTTP request to the server, and display the server
response as an output. You can assume that the HTTP request sent is a GET method.
The client should take inputs specifying the server IP address or host name, the port at which the
server is listening, and the path at which the requested object is stored at the server.
